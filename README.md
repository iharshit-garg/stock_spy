# Stock Spy
This project is created as a part of my journey to become proficient in Python and to pivot to quant development.

## Requirements:
- Python > 3.12
- yfinance

## Project Scope / Features
### Basic Version:
- Enter a stock ticker (e.g., AAPL)
- Fetch current stock price and display it

### Intermediate Version:
- Fetch historical prices for the last n days
- Display highest, lowest, and average price
- Save data to a CSV file

### Advanced Version:
- Fetch multiple stocks at once
- Plot price trends with matplotlib
- Set up a “watchlist” that alerts when a price crosses a threshold

## Key Python Concepts / Libraries to Use
- Requests / urllib → Fetch API or web data
- BeautifulSoup / lxml → Parse HTML if scraping
- pandas → Organize data, calculate averages, save CSV
- matplotlib / plotly → Visualize trends
- datetime → Handle dates for historical data
- Optional: smtplib → Send email alerts
